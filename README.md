# AWS ML Workflow for Image Classification

This project demonstrates a machine learning workflow for image classification using AWS services. The goal is to guide users through the process of building, training, and deploying a machine learning model to classify images.

## Features
- **AWS Integration**: Leveraging AWS services like S3, SageMaker, and Lambda for end-to-end machine learning workflows.
- **Image Classification**: Utilizing popular machine learning libraries to build a model capable of classifying images into predefined categories.
- **Automation**: Automating the ML workflow with scripts and configuration files.
  
## Project Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML page (likely for a web-based interface or dashboard).
- `script.py`: The Python script that handles the core image classification logic.
- `step.json`: Configuration file for setting up or managing the workflow steps in AWS.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- An AWS account with permissions to create and manage S3 buckets, SageMaker endpoints, and Lambda functions.
- Python 3.x installed on your local machine.
- Required Python libraries: TensorFlow, PyTorch, boto3, etc. (Add specific libraries as per your `script.py` requirements).

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
